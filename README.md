# CTF-OverTheWire

My solutions to: [OverTheWire](http://overthewire.org/wargames/ "OverTheWire's Homepage")

## Encrytion / Decryption

Each "Level_Passwords" file will be encode with `openssl enc -aes-256-cbc -salt -in Level_Passwords.txt -out Level_Passwords.out`
If you really want the passwords, you will have to decrypt each file with `openssl enc -d -aes-256-cbc -in Level_Passwords.out`

## Info

This repo is for me to keep track of progress / passwords. I plan to password protect any files that will openly spoil the CTF (Game). I shall include password `SpoilIt4Moi` if you want to check or validate the next box.

I am new to CTF's so this is a learning opportunity; after every section I will leave a write-up PDF/ MD file.

## Irony

If you have completed Bandit, *hint* for this repo.
