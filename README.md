# CTF-OverTheWire

My solutions to: [OverTheWire](http://overthewire.org/wargames/ "OverTheWire's Homepage")

## Info

This repo is for me to keep track of progress / passwords. I plan to password protect any files that will openly spoil the CTF (Game). I shall include password `password-placeholder` if you want to check or validate the next box.

I am new to CTF's so this is a learning opportunity; after every section I will leave a write-up PDF/ MD file.
